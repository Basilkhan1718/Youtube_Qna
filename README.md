ðŸŽ¬ YouTube Q&A & Quiz App (RAG with Google Gemini)

This project lets you **ask questions, search, and generate quizzes from a YouTube video's transcript, using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Google Gemini AI.

It:
- Downloads subtitles from YouTube
- Splits them into timestamped chunks
- Embeds them into a FAISS vector database
- Uses a retriever to find relevant transcript segments
- Passes them to Gemini to answer questions only using transcript content
- Supports transcript search, quiz generation, and export to PDF/DOCX/CSV
- Can be run as a Streamlit web app
